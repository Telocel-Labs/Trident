# Fails if two migrations share a version prefix (issue #371).
#
# sqlx derives a migration's version from the leading digits of its filename
# and stores it as the primary key of _sqlx_migrations. Two files with the
# same prefix therefore collide on insert, and `sqlx migrate run` aborts
# part-way through — leaving the database on whichever of the two happened to
# apply first. This is easy to introduce by accident: contributors branch from
# an older dev and pick "the next number", which someone else has also picked.
#
# CI's integration job applies migrations with a `for f in *.sql` psql loop
# rather than the migrator, so it does NOT catch this. Hence the explicit check.
