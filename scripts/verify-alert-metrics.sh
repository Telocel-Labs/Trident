# Verify that every metric name referenced in Prometheus alert rules actually

#   ./scripts/verify-alert-metrics.sh <api-metrics-url> <indexer-metrics-url>
#
# Example (local docker compose):

#     http://localhost:3000/metrics \
#     http://localhost:9090/metrics
#
# Example (staging):
#   ./scripts/verify-alert-metrics.sh \
#     https://api-staging.trident.example/metrics \
#     https://indexer-staging.trident.example/metrics
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - all referenced metrics exist
#   1 - one or more metrics are missing
#   2 - usage error or connectivity failure

# are checking that a name exists, not that traffic has happened, so a
# declaration counts.
