# Prove exactly-once event persistence under concurrent indexers (issue #418).
#
# Runs the Rust integration tests that drive two real indexer writers against
# one Postgres over the same ledger range, then independently re-checks the
# database for duplicate natural keys and a monotonic cursor.
#
# The assertions live in Rust (crates/indexer/src/db/mod.rs) so they run in CI
# with the rest of the suite; this script is the operator-facing entry point
# that also verifies the invariant directly in SQL — a second opinion that does
# not depend on the same code under test.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/test-concurrent-persistence.sh [--database-url URL]
#
# Requires: a Postgres reachable via TEST_DATABASE_URL (or --database-url) with
# the migration chain applied.
