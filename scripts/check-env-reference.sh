# This is a grep-based check, not a compiler plugin: it scans for
# std::env::var("X") / env::var("X") in Rust and os.Getenv("X") in Go, then
# checks each hit appears (as a whole word, wrapped in backticks) in
# docs/ENVIRONMENT.md. False positives are possible on ALL_CAPS string
# literals that aren't actually env var names — those are allow-listed
# below, not silently skipped.
