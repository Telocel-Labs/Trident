# Alert runbook

One section per alert in [`monitoring/alerts.yml`](../../monitoring/alerts.yml).
Each section covers what the alert means, why its threshold was picked, and
the first steps to take when it fires. See
[`docs/metrics-catalog.md`](../metrics-catalog.md) for what every metric
referenced here actually measures.

## TridentIndexerLagWarning

**Means:** the indexer is more than 200 ledgers behind the Stellar chain tip,
sustained for 10 minutes.

**Why this threshold:** 200 ledgers is the same default as
`ALERT_LAG_THRESHOLD`, the indexer's own app-level webhook alert (issue #75)
— reusing it keeps the two alerting paths (webhook + Prometheus) agreeing on
what "behind" means. The 10-minute `for` absorbs normal RPC jitter and brief
upstream slowdowns without paging.

**First steps:**
1. Check `trident_indexer_rpc_call_duration_seconds` and
   `trident_indexer_rpc_errors_total` — is the Stellar RPC node slow or
   erroring? (see `TridentIndexerRPCErrorRateHigh` below)
2. Check `trident_indexer_db_pool_size`/`_idle_connections` — is the
   indexer's own Postgres write path the bottleneck?
3. If both look healthy, check indexer logs for retries/backoff — the RPC
   node may be silently rate-limiting.

## TridentIndexerLagCritical

**Means:** the indexer is more than 1000 ledgers behind, sustained for 5
minutes — API consumers are now reading meaningfully stale data.

**Why this threshold:** 1000 ledgers (~1.5 hours of Stellar ledger time) is
well past "temporarily slow" and into "effectively stalled." The shorter
5-minute window reflects the higher severity — page sooner once lag is this
large.

**First steps:** same as `TridentIndexerLagWarning`, but treat as
page-worthy immediately; also check `TridentIndexerHeartbeatStale` — a lag
this large with a stale heartbeat means the poll loop itself is hung, not
just slow.

## TridentIndexerHeartbeatStale

**Means:** `trident_indexer_last_poll_timestamp_seconds` — updated once per
poll-loop iteration regardless of outcome — hasn't advanced in over 5
minutes.

**Why this threshold:** the heartbeat ticks once per loop iteration
(typically every `POLL_INTERVAL_MS`, default 1s, capped at 60s). 5 minutes is
a large multiple of even the slowest configured poll interval, so staleness
past that point means the loop itself is hung — deadlocked, panicked past a
supervisor's catch, or blocked on I/O that will never return — not just
running slowly.

**First steps:**
1. Check indexer process status / restart count (`kubectl get pods` or
   `docker compose ps`) — has it actually crashed and is failing to restart?
2. If the process is running but heartbeat is stale, capture a stack
   dump/profile if possible before restarting — this is the "hung but alive"
   case the dead-man's-switch exists to catch.
3. Restart the indexer; the cursor is persisted in `system_state`, so a
   restart resumes safely without reprocessing or data loss.

## TridentIndexerMetricsMissing

**Means:** no `trident_indexer_last_poll_timestamp_seconds` series exists at
all — Prometheus can't find the metric, as opposed to finding it stale.

**Why this threshold:** distinguishes "the indexer is emitting metrics but
hung" (`TridentIndexerHeartbeatStale`) from "the indexer's `/metrics` isn't
scrapeable at all" (crashed, network partition, misconfigured scrape target).
3 minutes gives one scrape-interval's worth of margin before treating it as
real.

**First steps:** check the indexer process is running and `/metrics` is
reachable from Prometheus's network (`curl http://indexer:9090/metrics`);
check Prometheus's Targets page for scrape errors on the `trident-indexer`
job.

## TridentIndexerProcessDown

**Means:** Prometheus's own `up{job="trident-indexer"}` is 0 — the scrape
itself is failing (connection refused/timeout), for 2 minutes.

**Why this threshold:** `up` is the standard, library-level signal for "this
target isn't reachable at all." 2 minutes covers one or two missed scrapes
without paging on a single transient network blip.

**First steps:** same as `TridentIndexerMetricsMissing` — this is usually the
same underlying problem (process down or network partition) observed from
Prometheus's scrape health instead of the metric's own staleness.

## TridentIndexerParseErrorRateHigh

**Means:** over 1% of events in the last 10 minutes failed XDR decoding and
were written to `parse_errors` (parse-error isolation) instead of being
indexed.

**Why this threshold:** a small, steady trickle of parse errors is expected
(unusual contract event shapes, XDR edge cases) and shouldn't page. 1%
sustained for 15 minutes indicates something systemic — e.g. an RPC/XDR
schema change the parser doesn't handle — rather than a handful of one-off
malformed events.

**First steps:**
1. Query `parse_errors` for the most recent rows and inspect `raw_payload` /
   `error_message` for a common pattern.
2. Check whether a Stellar protocol upgrade or RPC node version bump
   coincides with the spike.
3. If it's a new, valid event shape, this is a parser bug — file/fix rather
   than treating it as transient.

## TridentIndexerInsertDeadLetterNonZero

**Means:** a well-formed event exhausted its bounded insert retries and was
written to `failed_events` instead of `soroban_events` (issue #208).

**Why this threshold:** fires on any occurrence in a 15-minute window, not a
rate. Unlike `TridentIndexerParseErrorRateHigh` above — which tolerates a
small baseline trickle of malformed chain data — there is no expected
baseline here: the event already decoded successfully, so a failure to
persist it points at the storage layer itself (a schema/constraint mismatch,
a sustained DB outage, or a genuine bug), not chain-data noise.

**First steps:**
1. Query `failed_events` for the most recent rows and inspect `error_message`
   / `payload` for a common pattern.
2. If `error_message` names a constraint or type error, this is a
   schema/decoder mismatch — a fix needs to land before affected events can
   be replayed.
3. If it coincides with a Postgres outage or connection exhaustion
   (`trident_indexer_db_pool_size`/`_idle_connections`), the underlying
   incident is the priority; the dead-lettered rows can be replayed once the
   database is healthy again by re-driving them through the normal insert
   path (no automatic replay tooling exists yet — issue #208 scoped that
   out).

## TridentIndexerRPCErrorRateHigh

**Means:** over 5% of Stellar RPC calls (`getEvents`/`getLedgers`) errored in
the last 5 minutes (issue #297).

**Why this threshold:** RPC nodes occasionally return isolated errors under
load; 5% sustained for 10 minutes is well above normal noise and usually
means the upstream node is degraded or rate-limiting.

**First steps:**
1. Check `trident_indexer_rpc_call_duration_seconds` for the same method
   — is latency also elevated (overload) or normal (outright rejections)?
2. Check the RPC provider's status page / try a manual `getHealth` call
   against `STELLAR_RPC_URL`.
3. If a fallback/alternate RPC endpoint is configured, consider failing over.

## TridentIndexerRPCErrorRateCritical

**Means:** over 25% of Stellar RPC calls errored in the last 5 minutes.

**Why this threshold:** at this error rate the indexer is very likely
effectively stalled (most poll cycles failing outright). Page immediately
rather than waiting the full 10-minute window used for the warning tier.

**First steps:** same as `TridentIndexerRPCErrorRateHigh`, treated as
immediate: fail over to an alternate RPC endpoint if one exists, or escalate
to the RPC provider.

## TridentAPIHTTP5xxRateHigh

**Means:** over 5% of Go API requests returned a 5xx in the last 5 minutes,
sustained for 10 minutes.

**Why this threshold:** individual 5xx responses happen (a single bad
request, a momentary DB blip); 5% sustained is a real, ongoing failure mode
rather than noise.

**First steps:**
1. Check `trident_api_db_pool_acquired_connections` /
   `trident_api_db_pool_max_connections` — is the pool saturated?
2. Check `TridentAPIDependencyUnhealthy` — is Postgres/Redis/gRPC down?
3. Break down by `route` (`trident_api_http_requests_total{status=~"5..",...}`)
   to see if it's isolated to one endpoint or API-wide.

## TridentAPIHTTP5xxRateCritical

**Means:** over 25% of Go API requests are failing with a 5xx, sustained for
5 minutes — the API is largely unusable.

**Why this threshold:** at 25%+ the service is failing for a meaningful
fraction of all callers; the shorter window pages faster than the warning
tier.

**First steps:** same as `TridentAPIHTTP5xxRateHigh`, treated as immediate —
check dependency health first since a downed Postgres/Redis is the most
common cause of an API-wide 5xx spike this large.

## TridentAPIProcessDown

**Means:** `up{job="trident-api"}` is 0 for 2 minutes — Prometheus can't
scrape the Go API at all.

**Why this threshold:** same reasoning as `TridentIndexerProcessDown` — `up`
is the standard scrape-health signal, 2 minutes covers a missed scrape or
two without paging on a blip.

**First steps:** check process status and container/pod logs; check
`readinessProbe`/`livenessProbe` results if running under Kubernetes (see
`helm/trident/values.yaml`).

## TridentAPIDependencyUnhealthy

**Means:** `GET /v1/health` has been returning non-200 for 5 minutes. That
endpoint checks Postgres, Redis, and the gRPC backend concurrently and fails
if any one of them does.

**Why this threshold:** relies on the Helm chart's liveness/readiness probes
(or an equivalent external health check) polling `/v1/health` every ~10s to
keep `trident_api_http_requests_total{route="GET /v1/health"}` moving; 5
minutes gives ample margin over that polling interval before treating a
failure as sustained rather than a single flaky check. If you deploy without
those probes (e.g. bare `docker compose`), add an equivalent periodic health
check — otherwise this alert has no samples to evaluate.

**First steps:**
1. `curl` `/v1/health` directly and read the `checks` field
   (`postgres`/`redis`/`grpc_api`) to see which dependency is failing.
2. If Postgres: check `TridentAPIDBPoolSaturated` and the database's own
   health/connection count.
3. If Redis: check Redis process health and `trident_api_redis_stream_length`
   for a consumer that's stopped reading.

## TridentAPIDBPoolSaturated

**Means:** over 90% of the Go API's Postgres connection pool has been
checked out for 10 minutes.

**Why this threshold:** 90% is a leading indicator — the pool isn't
exhausted yet, but requests will start queuing (and eventually timing out on
acquire) once it is. 10 minutes filters out brief bursts that a healthy pool
absorbs on its own.

**First steps:**
1. Check for slow queries or a query holding connections open longer than
   expected (`pg_stat_activity` on the database).
2. Check request volume — is this organic traffic growth that needs a larger
   `GO_API_DB_POOL_SIZE`, or a leak/regression?
3. As a mitigation, `GO_API_DB_POOL_SIZE` can be raised without a code
   change, but treat it as a stopgap if the root cause is a query regression.

## Observability RPC alerts (observability/rpc-alerts.yml)

The following alerts monitor Stellar RPC provider health — latency, error
rate, and failover state — so ops can see "RPC is degraded" before it turns
into ingest lag.

## TridentRPCHighErrorRate

**Means:** over 10% of Stellar RPC calls have failed over the last 5 minutes,
sustained for 5 minutes.

**Why this threshold:** 10% sustained error rate indicates the upstream RPC
node is degraded, rate-limiting, or unreachable — not just isolated
transient failures. This is a leading indicator that will turn into ingest
lag if not addressed.

**First steps:**
1. Check `trident_indexer_rpc_errors_total` and break down by `error_type`
   to distinguish rate-limited vs timing-out vs bad request shape.
2. Check `trident_indexer_rpc_active_endpoint` to see if failover has
   already kicked in to a secondary RPC provider.
3. Check the RPC provider's status page or try a manual health check against
   `STELLAR_RPC_URL`.

**Known causes:**
- RPC provider under load or rate-limiting
- Network partition between indexer and RPC endpoint
- Invalid cursor/pagination state (check for `invalid_cursor` error_type)

**Mitigation:** configure a fallback RPC endpoint if one exists; consider
raising rate limits with the provider.

**Escalation:** if sustained for >15 minutes and no fallback is available,
escalate to the RPC provider or switch endpoints.

## TridentRPCHighLatency

**Means:** p95 latency for a specific RPC method (e.g., `getEvents`) has
exceeded 5 seconds, sustained for 10 minutes.

**Why this threshold:** 5s p95 is a degraded-but-still-responding provider,
distinct from outright timeouts. Left unaddressed, high latency typically
turns into ingest lag as the indexer's poll loop spends most of its time
waiting on slow RPC responses.

**First steps:**
1. Check which method is slow: break down
   `trident_indexer_rpc_call_duration_seconds` by `method` label.
2. Check if this correlates with elevated error rate
   (`TridentRPCHighErrorRate`) — often both fire together when the provider
   is overloaded.
3. Check `trident_indexer_rpc_timeouts_total` — are requests timing out
   entirely, or just responding slowly?

**Known causes:**
- RPC provider under load
- Large response payloads (many events per ledger)
- Network congestion between indexer and RPC endpoint

**Mitigation:** if a secondary RPC endpoint is available, consider manual
failover or allowing the automatic failover logic to switch.

**Escalation:** if sustained for >30 minutes, escalate to the RPC provider
or investigate network path.

## TridentRPCFailoverActive

**Means:** `trident_indexer_rpc_active_endpoint` has been non-zero (not the
primary) for at least 5 minutes — the indexer is running on a fallback RPC
endpoint.

**Why this threshold:** failover is working as designed to keep the indexer
running when the primary is down. This alert is informational ("you're on
backup power") rather than urgent, but should be investigated before the
backup fails too.

**First steps:**
1. Check `trident_indexer_rpc_failovers_total` to see how often failover has
   occurred — frequent flapping suggests both endpoints are unstable.
2. Check whether the primary RPC endpoint has recovered — try a manual health
   check or `getHealth` call.
3. Check `trident_indexer_rpc_errors_total` for the primary endpoint to see
   why failover triggered.

**Known causes:**
- Primary RPC provider outage or maintenance window
- Primary endpoint rate-limiting or rejecting requests
- Network partition to primary endpoint

**Mitigation:** if the primary has recovered, the indexer will automatically
fail back on the next poll cycle (no manual intervention needed). If the
primary is still down, ensure the fallback endpoint has sufficient capacity
for sustained traffic.

**Escalation:** if both primary and fallback are degraded, page on-call to
add a third endpoint or escalate to RPC provider(s).

## TridentRPCRateLimited

**Means:** `trident_indexer_rpc_errors_total{error_type="rate_limited"}` has
been climbing for 5+ minutes — the Stellar RPC provider is actively
rate-limiting the indexer.

**Why this threshold:** sustained rate-limiting degrades ingest freshness the
same way an outage does, but is a distinct root cause (quota exhausted rather
than provider down) that requires a different mitigation (raise quota vs fail
over).

**First steps:**
1. Check the indexer's configured poll interval (`POLL_INTERVAL_MS`) — if
   it's very aggressive (e.g., <1s), consider backing off slightly.
2. Check `trident_indexer_rpc_call_duration_seconds_count` to estimate
   request rate — are we exceeding the provider's documented limits?
3. Check the RPC provider's dashboard/billing page to see current quota usage
   and limits.

**Known causes:**
- Indexer poll rate exceeds RPC provider's quota
- Other consumers sharing the same RPC quota
- Provider has reduced quota limits (check provider changelog/announcements)

**Mitigation:** raise the provider's quota if possible; add a secondary RPC
endpoint to the pool to distribute load; back off poll interval slightly if
latency tolerance allows.

**Escalation:** if quota cannot be raised and no secondary endpoint is
available, escalate to product/eng to prioritize RPC provider migration or
multi-provider setup.

## SLO burn-rate alerts (observability/burn-rate-alerts.yml)

The following alerts implement multi-window, multi-burn-rate monitoring for
the SLOs defined in docs/slo.md (issue #296). They follow the Google SRE
workbook pattern: a short window confirms the burn is happening *now*, a long
window confirms it's sustained (not a blip) — both must breach before paging.

## IngestFreshnessFastBurn

**Means:** ledger lag has exceeded the 30s target (docs/slo.md SLO 1) for a
large share of both the last 5 minutes and the last 1 hour, consuming the
28-day error budget at 14.4x — exhausts the whole monthly budget in ~2 days
if sustained.

**Why this threshold:** fast burn (14.4x) is high enough to be page-worthy
immediately — it's not a transient blip if both the 5m and 1h windows agree
— but not so high that it triggers on every momentary spike.

**First steps:**
1. Check `trident_indexer_ledger_lag` current value — how far behind is the
   indexer right now?
2. Check `trident_indexer_rpc_retries_total` and
   `trident_indexer_rpc_failovers_total` — is the RPC layer struggling?
3. Check `trident_indexer_last_poll_timestamp_seconds` — is the poll loop
   stalled entirely, or just slow?

**Known causes:**
- RPC provider degradation (see `TridentRPCHighErrorRate`,
  `TridentRPCHighLatency`)
- Database write path bottleneck (check `trident_indexer_db_pool_size` and
  Postgres slow query log)
- Indexer restart/deploy during high ledger activity

**Mitigation:** if RPC is the bottleneck, fail over to a secondary endpoint
or back off poll interval slightly; if DB is the bottleneck, scale the DB or
increase the indexer's connection pool.

**Escalation:** page on-call immediately — fast burn exhausts the monthly
budget in under 2 days.

## IngestFreshnessSlowBurn

**Means:** ledger lag has exceeded 30s for a sustained share of both the last
30 minutes and the last 6 hours, consuming the error budget at 6x — exhausts
the budget in ~5 days if sustained.

**Why this threshold:** slow burn (6x) is not urgent enough to page
immediately, but indicates a sustained problem that needs investigation before
it becomes a fast burn. The longer windows (30m/6h) filter out transient
issues the fast-burn rule would already catch.

**First steps:**
1. Check the same diagnostic metrics as `IngestFreshnessFastBurn` but with
   lower urgency — this is a leading indicator, not an active outage.
2. Check whether this correlates with any recent deploys, config changes, or
   upstream Stellar protocol upgrades.
3. Review `trident_indexer_rpc_errors_total` and
   `trident_indexer_parse_errors_total` for elevated rates.

**Known causes:**
- Slightly degraded RPC latency not yet crossing the `TridentRPCHighLatency`
  threshold
- Gradual increase in ledger activity (more events per ledger) without a
  corresponding indexer capacity increase
- Small config regression (e.g., poll interval accidentally increased)

**Mitigation:** address the root cause before it becomes a fast burn —
optimize indexer throughput, scale DB, or add RPC capacity.

**Escalation:** create a ticket rather than paging — investigate during
business hours before it escalates to fast burn.

## IndexerHeartbeatStalled

**Means:** `trident_indexer_last_poll_timestamp_seconds` has not advanced in
over 2 minutes — the indexer poll loop has not completed a cycle.

**Why this threshold:** this is a dead-man's-switch for the SLO: if the
indexer dies outright or the metric stops being scraped, the lag-ratio alerts
above can miss it (flat line looks healthy). 2 minutes is well above any
reasonable poll interval, so staleness means the indexer is hung, crashed, or
stuck retrying RPC.

**First steps:**
1. Check indexer process status (`kubectl get pods` or `docker compose ps`) —
   is it running, restarting, or crashed?
2. Check `trident_indexer_rpc_errors_total` — is it stuck retrying RPC
   failures?
3. If the process is alive but stalled, capture a stack dump/profile before
   restarting.

**Known causes:**
- Indexer process crashed or killed (OOM, segfault, panic)
- Poll loop deadlocked or blocked on I/O
- RPC provider completely unreachable (not just slow or erroring, but
  connection refused / timeout on every request)

**Mitigation:** restart the indexer — the cursor is persisted in
`system_state`, so restart is safe.

**Escalation:** page on-call immediately — a stalled indexer violates the
ingest-freshness SLO directly.

## TridentIngestLagSustainedHigh

**Means:** `trident_indexer_ledger_lag_seconds_estimated` (lag expressed in
estimated wall-clock seconds, assuming ~5s per ledger) has been above 500s
(~100 ledgers) for 10 minutes.

**Why this threshold:** this is a direct, human-readable threshold alert
independent of the error-budget/burn-rate math above. 100 ledgers (~8 minutes
of lag) sustained for 10 minutes is well past "transient slowdown" and into
"the indexer is falling behind." Mirrors the fields exposed by
`GET /v1/stats/indexer` (docs/observability/data-freshness.md).

**First steps:**
1. Check `trident_indexer_ledger_lag` (the raw ledger-count lag) and
   `trident_indexer_rpc_active_endpoint` to see if RPC failover has occurred.
2. Check `trident_indexer_rpc_errors_total` — is the RPC provider the cause?
3. Same diagnostic steps as `IngestFreshnessFastBurn` — this is an alternate
   view of the same underlying problem.

**Known causes:** same as `IngestFreshnessFastBurn` (RPC degradation, DB
bottleneck, indexer restart during high activity).

**Mitigation:** same as `IngestFreshnessFastBurn`.

**Escalation:** page on-call — this crosses the "API consumers are reading
meaningfully stale data" threshold.

## TridentDiskFillingWithin14Days

**Means:** extrapolating the last 6 hours of growth, the Postgres data volume
runs out of space within 14 days.

**Why this threshold:** it is a provisioning signal, not an incident. Disk
growth is measured, not guessed — 890 bytes per event including indexes, over
500k rows on the full migration chain
(docs/performance.md#storage-capacity-and-disk-growth). At the 10x testnet
rate that is ~17 GiB/month, so a volume can go from comfortable to full inside
a quarter. 14 days is chosen to leave room to provision, migrate, and verify
rather than to react.

**First steps:**
1. Confirm the trend is real and not a one-off:
   `node_filesystem_avail_bytes{mountpoint="/var/lib/postgresql"}` over 7d.
2. Check what is actually growing — `soroban_events` is the expected answer:
   ```sql
   SELECT relname, pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(c.oid))
     FROM pg_class c JOIN pg_namespace n ON n.oid = c.relnamespace
    WHERE n.nspname = 'public'
    ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(c.oid) DESC LIMIT 10;
   ```
3. Decide between resizing the volume and enabling partition retention. Because
   `soroban_events` is RANGE-partitioned by `ledger_sequence` (migration 0017),
   dropping the oldest partition is a fast metadata operation, not a bulk
   DELETE:
   ```sql
   DROP TABLE soroban_events_p0_1999999;
   ```
   Confirm the retention policy before dropping — those events are gone.

## TridentDiskFillingWithin48Hours

**Means:** the same projection, now inside 48 hours.

**Why this threshold:** at this point provisioning lead time is mostly gone, so
this pages rather than warns. A full volume does not degrade gracefully — the
indexer stops committing and the API fails writes.

**First steps:**
1. Resize the volume now if the platform supports online resize. This is the
   only action that does not lose data.
2. If a resize is not immediately available, drop the oldest
   `soroban_events` partition (see the query above) to buy time.
3. Check for a non-obvious consumer before assuming it is event growth: an
   unrotated WAL (`SELECT pg_size_pretty(sum(size)) FROM pg_ls_waldir();`) or a
   stalled replication slot holds space that no partition drop will release.

## TridentDiskSpaceLow

**Means:** less than 15% of the Postgres data volume remains, regardless of
trend.

**Why this threshold:** the two predictive alerts above extrapolate a 6-hour
trend, which cannot see a step change — a large backfill, a WAL pileup behind a
stalled replication slot, or a runaway temp file. This is the backstop for
those, so it fires on the level rather than the slope.

**First steps:**
1. Identify the consumer: `pg_ls_waldir()` for WAL,
   `pg_stat_replication` / `pg_replication_slots` for a stalled slot, and the
   table-size query above for ordinary growth.
2. A stalled replication slot is the most common non-obvious cause — an
   inactive slot pins WAL indefinitely. Drop it if the replica is genuinely
   gone: `SELECT pg_drop_replication_slot('<name>');`
3. If it is ordinary growth, treat it as
   `TridentDiskFillingWithin48Hours` above.
