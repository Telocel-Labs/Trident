# Rollback runbook

**Status: template — not yet rehearsed.** Issue #460 asks for this
procedure to be executed end-to-end on staging, with wall-clock time
measured, before launch. That rehearsal needs actual staging access and
hasn't been performed in this pass. What follows is the documented
procedure and — critically — a real finding about migration
reversibility that should inform the rehearsal.

## Finding: migrations here are forward-only

`database/migrations/` has 25 numbered `.sql` files and **zero**
corresponding `.down.sql` (or equivalent reverse) files. That means there
is currently no automated way to reverse a schema migration — "which
migrations are reversible" is, today, **none of them** in an automated
sense. Any rollback that needs to undo a schema change requires either:

- Rolling back to the previous **application** version only, leaving the
  new schema in place (safe only if the new schema is backward-compatible
  with the old app version — this is the expand/contract pattern the
  issue asks about, and it isn't consistently followed today since there's
  no tooling enforcing it), or
- A hand-written reverse SQL script, written and reviewed under incident
  pressure — the worst time to write one for the first time.

**Recommendation** (not implemented in this pass): require a `.down.sql`
alongside every new migration going forward, and treat any migration that
can't be cleanly reversed (e.g. a dropped column) as needing an
expand/contract split — add the new shape, migrate data, only drop the
old shape in a later, separate release once nothing depends on it.

## Application rollback procedure (image + chart)

1. Identify the previous known-good image tag and Helm chart revision:
   ```bash
   helm history trident -n <namespace>
   ```
2. Roll back the release:
   ```bash
   helm rollback trident <PREVIOUS_REVISION> -n <namespace>
   ```
3. Verify the rolled-back pods are serving:
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout status deployment/go-api -n <namespace>
   kubectl rollout status deployment/grpc-api -n <namespace>
   kubectl rollout status deployment/indexer -n <namespace>
   curl -sf https://<host>/v1/health
   ```
4. Confirm the indexer resumed from the correct cursor (no double-processed
   or skipped events) — check `soroban_events` for a gap or duplicate
   around the rollback timestamp.

## Rollback across a migration boundary

If the incident requires undoing a release that included a schema
migration:

1. **If the new schema is backward-compatible** with the previous app
   version (additive only — new nullable column, new table, new index):
   roll back the application per the steps above and leave the schema as
   is. This is the only rollback path this repo currently supports
   cleanly.
2. **If the migration is not backward-compatible** (a dropped/renamed
   column, a changed constraint the old app version doesn't expect): there
   is currently no automated reverse path. This must be handled by a
   manually-written, reviewed reverse script — which is exactly the
   scenario the "migrations are forward-only" finding above means to flag
   as a gap to close before relying on this runbook under real pressure.

## What this rehearsal still needs (not done here)

- [ ] Actually run the above against staging, end to end.
- [ ] Record wall-clock time from "rollback called" to "verified serving."
- [ ] Attempt a migration-boundary rollback against a real backward-
      incompatible migration (staging only) to see what actually breaks.
- [ ] Update this runbook with the exact commands/output from the
      rehearsal, not the generic commands above.
