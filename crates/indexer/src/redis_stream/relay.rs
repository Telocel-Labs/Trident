//! Outbox relay: drains `event_outbox` onto the Redis Stream (issue #200).
//!
//! The poll loop commits events with an unpublished outbox row; this task
//! publishes them. It runs on its own interval and takes a bounded batch per
//! pass so it can never starve the poll loop or monopolise the database.
//!
//! Failure handling is deliberately conservative: a batch stops at the first
//! publish failure and only the rows published *before* it are marked, so
//! ordering is preserved and nothing is lost. The next pass resumes at the
//! failed row. That makes delivery at-least-once — consumers dedupe by event
//! id (see `db::outbox`).
