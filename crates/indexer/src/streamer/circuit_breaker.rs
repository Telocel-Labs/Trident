//! Circuit breaker for sustained Stellar RPC outages (issue #197).
//!
//! `poll_once` already retries a single `getEvents` call up to 5 times with
//! exponential backoff. That is fine for a blip, but when the RPC endpoint is
//! genuinely down, every poll interval still burns through all 5 retries —
//! logging, allocating, and hammering a provider that has already told us
//! (via 5 consecutive failures) that it is not going to answer. The breaker
//! sits one level up, around the whole poll cycle: after enough consecutive
//! poll failures it opens and the run loop skips calling `poll_once` entirely
//! for a cooldown period, sleeping instead.
//!
//! State machine (textbook Closed → Open → HalfOpen):
//!
//! ```text
//!            failure_threshold consecutive failures
//!   Closed ────────────────────────────────────────▶ Open
//!     ▲                                                │
//!     │ success                                        │ cooldown elapses
//!     │                                                 ▼
//!     └──────────────────────────────────────────  HalfOpen
//!                         failure (back to Open,
//!                         cooldown restarts)
//! ```
//!
//! In `HalfOpen`, exactly one probe call is allowed through; a success closes
//! the breaker and resets the failure count, a failure reopens it and resets
//! the cooldown clock.
