//! End-to-end ingest correctness against a real testnet contract (issue #419).
//!
//! The existing suite proves the parser handles synthetic input and that the
//! E2E job can observe one mint event. Neither proves the stronger property
//! this module targets: over a wide real ledger range, every event a known
//! contract emitted is present exactly once, decoded correctly, and in order.
//!
//! ## Why this does not run on every PR
//!
//! It talks to public testnet RPC, so it is neither hermetic nor fast, and
//! testnet is periodically reset. It is gated behind `TESTNET_RPC_URL` and runs
//! on a schedule (`.github/workflows/testnet-correctness.yml`) rather than
//! per-PR. That is also what makes it valuable: a scheduled run against live
//! RPC catches upstream format changes that a pinned fixture never would.
//!
//! ## Independently-derived expectations
//!
//! The acceptance criteria require expected values that do not come from our
//! own decoder — otherwise the test only proves the decoder agrees with itself.
//! Two independent references are used:
//!
//! 1. Server-assigned fields (`id`, `ledger`, `txHash`) that our code never
//!    computes, used for the presence/ordering/duplication assertions.
//! 2. A second XDR decode path for value assertions: production uses
//!    [`crate::parser::decode_scval`] (`read_xdr` over a `Limited` reader);
//!    the reference below uses `ScVal::from_xdr` on the raw byte slice. A bug
//!    in one cannot make both agree on a wrong answer.
